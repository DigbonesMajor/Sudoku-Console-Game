# Sudoku-Generator-Solver
This repository hosts the Source Code for Sudoku Windows console-application. The player will be given a Sudoku puzzle to solve, player can then attempt to solve it or see the solution if they cannot.

### Sudoku-Rules
Sudoku is played on a 9x9 grid. Player will be given some numbers as hints when the game is initiated, after which the player has to fill the Sudoku grid in such a way that the following 3 rules are obeyed:
1. Each digit from 1-9 should appear in a row once.
2. Each digit from 1-9 should appear in a column once.
3. Each 3x3 grid obtained on dividing the original 9x9 grid into 9 parts should have all digits from 1-9 occur once.

### Console-Game
Sudoku.exe was generated by building Source Code.cpp using Visual Studio 2019. Sudoku.exe was tested to be working perfectly fine on Windows 10/11 without any dependencies, but if you face any issue, you can try building it using Source Code.cpp.
For best user experience make sure the console window is set to **80x30**:
